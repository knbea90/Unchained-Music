# Unchained Music Distribution: Keep 100% Royalties, Zero Upfront Fees, Real Human Support

You know that feeling when you finally finish a track? That moment when you've poured your soul into every beat, every lyric, every mix adjustment, and you just want to get it out there. Then reality hits—how do you actually distribute this thing? Most platforms either want to take a chunk of your royalties or charge you annual fees that add up faster than coffee runs during studio sessions. It's exhausting before you even hit publish.

Here's where things get interesting. What if there was a way to distribute your music without choosing between keeping your earnings or paying subscription fees? That's exactly what Unchained Music figured out, and honestly, it's about time someone did.

## The Distribution Game Nobody Really Explained

Let's back up for a second. Music distribution used to be this mysterious process where you needed a label, connections, or at least someone who knew someone. Now we've got digital distributors everywhere, which is great, except they all want something from you. Some charge per release, others want annual subscriptions, and a few take percentages of your royalties like they're your silent business partner.

The math gets weird fast. Say you release four singles and an EP in a year on a platform that charges per release. Add in the annual renewal fees, maybe some extra costs for features you didn't know you'd need, and suddenly you're looking at a serious chunk of change before your music even makes a dollar. For independent artists just starting out—or even established ones trying to maximize their income—it feels like the system was designed for everyone except the actual musicians.

Unchained Music approached this differently. Instead of nickel-and-diming artists at every turn, they built a platform that actually works for musicians. Their core tier is genuinely free, and when I say free, I mean you're not giving up a percentage of your royalties. You keep 100% of what you earn. All of it. The whole thing.

Think about that for a moment. Every stream on Spotify, every download on Apple Music, every play on YouTube—that revenue goes straight to you. Not 85% of it after the platform takes their cut. Not 90% if you're on a "better" plan. One hundred percent. When your music generates income, you get all of it.

## When "Free" Actually Means Free

Now, we've all seen "free" offers that come with asterisks the size of billboards. Free for the first month, free with limited features, free until you want to actually do anything useful. So when Unchained Music says their Core plan is free, it's fair to be skeptical.

But here's the deal: their free tier isn't some stripped-down demo version. You get unlimited distribution to over 220 digital streaming platforms and stores worldwide. That includes all the major players—Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, TikTok, Deezer, Tidal, and about 215 others you might not have heard of but your international fans probably use.

You also get your own UPC and ISRC codes included, which other distributors often charge extra for. These codes are basically the fingerprints of your music in the digital world, helping platforms track your streams and sales accurately. Most services make you pay for these or force you to use theirs, which can complicate things if you ever want to switch distributors. Unchained just gives them to you.

The processing time is handled by actual humans, not just algorithms. Your release gets reviewed within five business days, which is pretty reasonable when you consider real people are checking your artwork, metadata, and audio quality. Some artists on the paid tiers mentioned getting their releases processed in just two days, but even five days beats the weeks-long waits some other platforms put you through.

If you're just starting out and want to test the waters without financial commitment, or you're an established artist tired of subscription fees eating into your profit margins, the Core plan handles the essentials without asking for your credit card. For a lot of musicians, that's genuinely all they need.

## The Paid Plans That Actually Make Sense

Sometimes you want more than the basics. Maybe you need faster processing because you've got a time-sensitive release. Perhaps you're managing multiple artist profiles, or you want priority support when something goes wrong. That's where Unchained's paid tiers come in, and unlike many competitors, they're not trying to bleed you dry.

Here's how the pricing breaks down:

| Plan | Annual Cost | Artist Profiles | Store Delivery | Key Features |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Core** | Free | 1 | 5 business days | Unlimited distribution to 220+ DSPs, keep 100% royalties, UPC & ISRC codes, track credits, release edits, pre-save links, YouTube OAC, analytics |
| **Grow** | $$14.99/year$$ | 1 ($$\+ \$9.99/year$$ per additional) | 2 business days | Everything in Core plus faster processing, 2-day support response, advanced track credits |
| **Pro** | $$29.99/year$$ | 3 included | 2 business days | Everything in Grow plus 3 artist profiles, 2-day support, splits with 15% commission, priority features |

The first thing you'll notice is how reasonable these prices are. We're talking about the cost of two fancy coffees per year for the Grow plan, or about five coffees for Pro. Compare that to other distributors charging similar amounts per month, and the value becomes obvious.

Both paid tiers cut your processing time down to two business days. If you're dropping a single to capitalize on current trends, or you need to coordinate releases across multiple platforms for a campaign, those extra three days can matter. You also get faster support response times—two business days instead of three, which doesn't sound like much until you're dealing with a release issue right before your launch date.

The Pro plan is where things get particularly interesting for artists managing multiple projects. You get three artist profiles included in that $$\$29.99$$ annual fee. If you're producing under different names, collaborating with various projects, or running a small label, that's essentially $$\$10$$ per profile per year. Other platforms charge that per month.

## Features That Work Like They're Supposed To

Distribution platforms love to brag about features, then bury the useful ones behind paywalls or make them so complicated you need a tutorial just to understand what they do. Unchained took a different approach—they included practical features across all tiers and made them actually accessible.

**YouTube Official Artist Channel** is available even on the free plan. For those who don't know, this is what gives you that verified checkmark and dedicated artist page on YouTube Music instead of just having your tracks scattered across random uploads. It consolidates your presence, looks professional, and helps fans find your complete catalog. Some distributors charge extra for this or reserve it for premium tiers. Unchained includes it.

**YouTube Content ID** is also available, though they take a 20% commission on revenue generated from Content ID claims. Before anyone panics about that percentage, understand what Content ID actually does: it monitors YouTube for other people using your music in their videos and claims that revenue on your behalf. Without Content ID, you get nothing when someone uses your track. With it, you get 80% of something, which is better than 100% of nothing. The commission covers the administrative costs of managing claims, which can get complicated.

**Pre-save links** come standard, which is huge for building momentum before a release. You can generate links that let fans save your upcoming track to their Spotify or Apple Music libraries before it drops. When release day hits, your song appears in their library automatically, which can boost your early stream counts and help with algorithmic playlisting.

**Release edits** are included, meaning if you spot a mistake in your metadata or need to update artwork, you're not stuck with it forever or forced to take down and reupload the entire release. Some platforms charge every time you make changes. Unchained just lets you fix things.

**Advanced track credits** let you properly acknowledge everyone involved in your music—producers, songwriters, featured artists, mixing engineers, whoever contributed. This helps with credibility, networking, and making sure everyone gets appropriate recognition in an industry that thrives on credits and collaborations.

The **cover song licensing** feature charges $$\$15$$ per song, which is actually on par with standalone licensing services. If you're releasing a cover, you need mechanical licenses for the songwriting, and Unchained handles that process for you instead of making you deal with Harry Fox Agency or similar services independently.

**Analytics** are available across all plans, giving you actual insight into where your streams are coming from, which songs are performing, and how your audience is growing. You're not flying blind trying to guess if that promotional push worked or which playlist actually moved the needle.

## The AI Music Question Nobody Wanted to Answer

Let's talk about something contentious: AI-generated music. This is where Unchained got really interesting, and depending on your perspective, it's either their best decision or their most controversial one.

In early 2025, the platform noticed what everyone in the distribution business was seeing—a massive flood of AI-generated tracks flooding the system. We're talking about thousands of generic instrumental pieces, algorithmically produced beats, and tracks clearly pumped out by the hundreds using AI generators. The problem wasn't that AI was involved; it was that the platform was becoming cluttered with low-effort, mass-produced content that diluted the catalog and made it harder for genuine artists to stand out.

Unchained decided to take a stance. They updated their content policies to require substantial human creative involvement in any music distributed through their platform. You can use AI tools—plenty of legitimate artists incorporate AI for mastering, generating backing tracks, or experimenting with sounds—but you need to demonstrate actual creative input. Arrangement, editing, performance, original composition—something that shows a human was meaningfully involved in the artistic process.

This decision upset some users who were mass-distributing AI content, which you'll see reflected in a few negative reviews online. But it resonated strongly with working musicians who were tired of competing for playlist spots against accounts uploading fifty generic tracks per week. Several artists in their Trustpilot reviews specifically praised this policy shift, saying it made the platform feel more legitimate and less like a content farm.

The policy isn't a blanket AI ban. If you're a producer using AI as a tool in your creative workflow, you're fine. If you're uploading batches of generic instrumentals with minimal human input, that's what they're filtering out. It's a nuanced position in an industry that's still figuring out where AI fits, and Unchained chose to prioritize quality over quantity.

## The Real Difference: Human Support That Exists

Here's something that shouldn't be revolutionary but somehow is: Unchained Music has actual human customer support that responds to you. Not chatbots programmed with generic responses. Not forums where you hope another user might have solved your issue. Real people who understand music distribution and can actually help when something goes wrong.

Based on user reviews, support response times are three business days for Core users and two business days for Grow and Pro users. That's not instant, but it's realistic, and more importantly, when they respond, they're helpful. Multiple reviews mentioned support staff catching metadata errors before releases went live, helping resolve false copyright claims, and even suggesting better release strategies based on tour schedules.

One artist mentioned reaching out late on a Thursday night with an issue about a featured artist credit. Support responded without drama and resolved it. Another talked about Unchained helping to normalize titles across a messy catalog, unify credits, and flag duplicate uploads from years ago that were confusing their reports.

This might sound basic, but try getting that level of attention from a major distributor with millions of users and automated support systems. You'll be waiting days for a templated response that doesn't actually address your specific problem, then waiting more days for follow-ups, by which time your release window has passed and the moment is gone.

The live chat feature is available during business hours, and several users specifically called out how helpful it was. No endless email threads, just direct conversation that solves problems quickly.

This human approach extends to their review process. Your releases get checked by actual people who understand music industry standards, which means they catch issues before your music hits platforms. Your artwork doesn't meet streaming platform requirements? They'll tell you before it causes problems. Metadata looks suspicious or incomplete? They'll flag it. Better to handle issues during review than deal with takedown notices after your release is live.

## Comparing the Competition (Without the Marketing Spin)

Everyone wants to know how Unchained stacks up against the big names—DistroKid, TuneCore, CD Baby. The honest answer is that it depends on what you value.

**DistroKid** charges around $$\$20-\$36$$ per year for unlimited releases, which seems reasonable until you realize that's the basic plan, and they charge extra for almost everything else. Want to customize your label name? Extra fee. Need splits for collaborators? Another fee. iTunes pre-orders? You guessed it. By the time you add the features most serious artists need, you're looking at $$\$50+$$ annually, and that's per artist. If you stop paying, your music comes down. That's the part nobody talks about—you're renting your distribution, not owning it.

**TuneCore** does things differently with per-release pricing. Singles cost money, albums cost more money, and you pay annual renewal fees to keep them live. The advantage is that each release stays up even if you stop distributing new music. The disadvantage is the costs add up fast if you're prolific. Release ten singles and an album in a year? You're spending serious money before any of those tracks earn a penny.

**CD Baby** charges per release with no annual fees, which is better for artists who release infrequently. But they take a percentage of your royalties—typically around 9%—which is fine if you're not making much but becomes expensive as your streams grow. A track that earns $$\$10,000$$ in royalties costs you $$\$900$$ through CD Baby. That same track through Unchained? You keep the entire $$\$10,000$$, minus only the yearly plan cost if you're not on free.

The math changes based on your situation. For artists just starting out or those who release occasionally, Unchained's free plan is hard to beat. For prolific artists releasing constantly, even Unchained's paid plans offer better value than competitors once you account for feature costs. And for artists making significant streaming revenue, keeping 100% of royalties instead of 85-91% becomes genuinely valuable.

Speed matters too. Unchained's 2-5 day processing times are competitive with DistroKid and faster than TuneCore's typical 7-14 day windows. If you're dropping music to capitalize on trends or coordinate with promotional campaigns, those days matter.

## What Users Actually Say (The Unfiltered Version)

Trustpilot reviews tell an interesting story. Unchained Music currently sits at a respectable rating with a mix of perspectives worth examining.

Several artists praised the human approach. One review mentioned switching from DistroKid and immediately feeling "like a real person again," with support staff reading rambling notes, helping fix messy data, and suggesting smarter release dates that aligned with tour schedules. Another called out the live chat support, saying "real humans, fast chat, honest feedback" kept them from rushing a single that wasn't ready.

The AI policy shift generated divided opinions. Artists making traditional music were overwhelmingly positive about it. One review said, "Huge relief that they scrubbed AI spam. Release times have improved, our tracks aren't buried under robo-albums anymore, and pitching feels fair again." Several others echoed this sentiment, appreciating that the platform prioritizes "actual music makers."

Some negative reviews exist, primarily from users whose accounts were flagged or terminated for policy violations. One involved a copyright dispute where the user didn't respond within the required 48-hour window, leading to account termination. Another was from someone whose AI-generated content was removed under the new policies. Unchained's responses to these reviews were professional and explained their reasoning, which provides transparency even in negative situations.

A few reviews mentioned the initial reapplication process for free accounts during their 2025 platform audit, which caused temporary confusion. One user said they got mixed notifications about their account status but ultimately was approved and has had stable service since. This seems to have been a one-time verification during a major policy transition rather than an ongoing issue.

The consistent theme across positive reviews is appreciation for the no-nonsense approach. Artists who want fair pricing, transparent policies, and actual support seem to find what they're looking for. Those expecting automated approval of mass-produced content or instant responses to every inquiry might be disappointed, but that's sort of the point—Unchained is optimizing for artist quality over content quantity.

## Partner Offers That Add Real Value

Beyond distribution, Unchained has partnership deals that are actually useful if you're working on promoting your music.

**Groover** offers 15% off promotion campaigns with the code **UNCHAINEDMUSICVIP15**. Groover is a platform where you can submit your music directly to curators, playlist editors, journalists, and radio stations who are obligated to listen and provide feedback. It's not guaranteed placement, but it's one of the more legitimate ways to get your music in front of industry professionals without relying on cold emails or hoping someone stumbles across your track organically.

They also have deals with services for radio campaigns, mastering tools, and cover licensing, which are available through their partner page. These aren't pushy upsells—they're optional resources if you need them.

## Who This Actually Works For

Let's be real about fit. Unchained Music works best for independent artists and small labels who want straightforward distribution without complexity or excessive costs. If you're just starting out and want to get your music on streaming platforms without spending money upfront, the free plan gives you legitimate distribution with no catches.

If you're an established independent artist releasing regularly, the paid plans offer excellent value. You're looking at $$\$14.99$$ or $$\$29.99$$ per year for features that competitors charge monthly for, and you're keeping 100% of your royalties instead of giving up percentages.

For small labels managing multiple artists, the Pro plan's three included profiles at $$\$29.99$$ annually is hard to beat. Add more profiles at $$\$9.99$$ each per year, and you're still spending less than most platforms charge for a single artist.

This probably isn't the best fit if you want aggressive marketing campaigns, major label services, or someone to handle your entire career strategy. Unchained focuses on distribution done well rather than trying to be everything for everyone. If you need complex splits involving multiple collaborators and intricate royalty arrangements, their splits feature is still in development (available on Pro with 15% commission), so you might need more robust options elsewhere for now.

It's also worth noting their stance on content quality. If your plan involves mass-uploading generic tracks, AI-generated or otherwise, they've made it clear that's not welcome. For artists making genuine music and treating their releases seriously, that's probably a positive thing.

## The Bottom Line Without the Sales Pitch

Music distribution shouldn't be complicated. You make music, you want it on streaming platforms, you want to keep the money you earn. Unchained Music figured out how to make that happen without layers of fees, percentage cuts, or feature paywalls that punish you for success.

Their free tier is genuinely free and functional. Their paid tiers cost less annually than most competitors charge monthly. You keep 100% of your royalties across all plans. Support is handled by actual humans who understand music. The platform reaches over 220 streaming services and stores worldwide. Processing times are reasonable. The interface is straightforward.

They've also made decisions about content quality that might not please everyone but suggest they're thinking about the long-term health of their platform and the artists who use it. Filtering out mass-produced generic content benefits everyone who's actually trying to build a music career rather than just upload volume.

Is it perfect? No platform is. But for independent artists who value transparency, fair pricing, and keeping control of their royalties, Unchained Music offers a genuinely compelling option in a distribution landscape that's often frustrating and expensive.

If you're tired of subscription fees, percentage cuts, and platforms that treat you like a revenue stream rather than an artist, it's worth checking out. The free plan costs nothing to try, the paid plans cost less than lunch, and either way, you're keeping every penny your music earns. That's how it should work.
